# Social-Network-API

## Description

The Social Network API was created to give users a way to interact with each other. In this day and age, social media is very popular so it seemed very fitting to make this application. By building this application, I learned how to use MongoDB and got to improve with creating routes.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

This application requires <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose">Mongoose</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express">Express.js</a>.

## Usage

To use the application, begin by setting up Express and Mongoose as instructed in the documentations. By running `node server.js`, the port will be started. Using Insomnia to carry out the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests will allow you to use the application. Routes can be found in the routes folder.
